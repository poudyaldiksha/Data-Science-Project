In the context of code, replacing -200 values with the median of a column is a data preprocessing step. Here's why this is typically done:

1. Handling Missing or Invalid Data
The value -200 is likely a placeholder for missing or invalid measurements in the dataset. Using placeholder values like -200 is common in datasets where missing data needs to be flagged explicitly.
Keeping these -200 values in the dataset would distort statistical calculations like mean, standard deviation, and model predictions.
2. Using the Median
The median is a robust measure of central tendency, meaning it is not significantly affected by outliers or extreme values in the data.
By replacing -200 with the column's median, you preserve the distribution of the data without introducing bias that might result from using the mean, especially in the presence of skewed data.
3. Ensuring Data Quality
Many machine learning algorithms and statistical analyses cannot handle missing or invalid values directly. Replacing them with meaningful estimates ensures that the data is suitable for analysis.
4. Consistency
The preprocessing ensures that your dataset remains consistent and interpretable. If the -200 values represent missing measurements, replacing them aligns with the goal of creating a clean dataset for analysis.
Example:
If a column contains these values:

[1.2, -200, 3.4, 2.8, -200]
And the median of the non--200 values is 2.8, replacing -200 values would result in:

[1.2, 2.8, 3.4, 2.8, 2.8]
This approach minimizes the impact of missing data while retaining the integrity of the dataset.
